# Feedback Board

Feedback Board is a web application that allows users to write and share feedback about companies.

Other users can upvote feedback and filter posts to view only those from specific companies.

Developed using Vanilla JavaScript, the app relies on local storage to persist data, ensuring feedback remains available across sessions.

This project was created as part of an online course, focusing on asynchronous data handling and user interaction.
